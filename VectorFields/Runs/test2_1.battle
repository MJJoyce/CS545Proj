# test2_1.battle
#
# This test uses the same bots as test2.battle. The only difference is that the tracking robot starts
# towards the middle of the arena instead of near the edge. This prevents the previously mentioned
# problem where the tracking bot is no longer able to locate the goal with its radar due to sudden
# direction changes. This still exibits the terribly slow movements due to the simple Robot model.
#
# Again, the source for the goal robot can be found in VectorFieldsMovingGoal.java
# The source for the tracking robot can be found in VectorFieldsSimpleMovingGoal.java
