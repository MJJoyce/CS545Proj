# test2.battle
#
# Runs a potential fields test where the tracking robot attempts to follow a goal that moves.
# VectorFieldsMovingGoal.java contains the source for the moving goal robot.
# VectorFieldsSimpleMovingGoal.java contains the source for the robot that attempts to navigate
#   towards the moving goal.
#
# Problems present with this method:
# When running this test, you will see that the robot attempts to locate the goal and them move
# towards it. Its movement is slow because of the physics of Robocode and the simple robots. The
# basic robot, which this example is inherited from, has blocking actions. Each action must execute
# entirely before the next may run. The robot still manages to track the goal well, albeit slowly,
# until it has to make a sharp turn to catch the goal with its radar. The robot can no longer scan
# the goal with its radar, and thus it thinks the old goal location is where it should go.
