# Multiple objects (including moving ones) along with a moving goal.
#
# This shows the final state that this aspect of the project end up in. The robot is able to navigate
# seemlessly through the various obstacles. The performance can be adjusted so that the robot 
# navigates faster in addition to other changes to affect the behaviour. Most of the default settings 
# for this run are meant to be conservative.
#
# Source code for the goal can be found in VectorFieldsMovingGoal
# Source code for the stationary obstacle is in the sample bots provided by robocode. Specifically
#       sample.SittingDuck
# Source code for the moving obstacles can be found in SimgpleMovingObstacle[1, 2]
#       The only difference between the two is their names.
# Source for the navigating bot can be found in VectorFieldsMultMovObsAvoid.java
