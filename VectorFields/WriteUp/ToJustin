Potential Fields performed quite well in the Robocode environment. Combining the advanced motion model with the potential fields approach allowed for smooth navigation and obstacle avoidance. The potential fields method was quite robust and handled changes to the environment the easiest. The primary limiter for performance was the ability to scan the environment fast enough with the radar sweeps. The navigating bot's max speed and obstacle avoidance radius had to be tuned with the radar in mind. Even so, the robot was able to navigate fairly complex environments. Ob course, that isn't to say that potential fields didn't have problems. Suboptimal navigation is always an issue that potential fields will have. This became especially true when obstacles were placed really close to the wall since the radar sweeps didn't read the distance to the walls. It would also rather avoid close obstacles than navigate between tight paths, which may not always be optimal. There is also the issue of local minima causing navigational issues. That being said, potential fields handled the environment quite well.
